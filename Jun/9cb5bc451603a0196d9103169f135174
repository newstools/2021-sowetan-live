More Covid-19 vaccine sites have been added in Nelson Mandela Bay. The new  sites come after weeks of the vaccine rollout being disrupted by a shortage of availability of the jab. Provincial health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the new sites were part of their plans to have 1,800 vaccination sites in the Eastern Cape. He said the additional sites were at: “We are still looking for a hall in the Linton Grange  and Kabega area,” he said. “We have so far received  76,000 doses of the vaccine. “Private patients and  those with appointments can get the vaccine at Clicks in Walmer Park, Sunridge Park, Kabega Park and  St George’s, and also Baywest Dis-Chem.” SA is in phase 2 of its vaccine programme, which  targets people aged 60 and above. Phase 1 saw healthcare workers being inoculated, while the third  phase will see the rest of the adult population getting the jab. Kupelo said 146,151 people had been vaccinated so far in the province, with Buffalo City Metro inoculating 41,658 — the highest number in the province — while the Bay had  reported vaccinating 33,189 people.
