Shadow World Investigations researcher Paul Holden on Tuesday told the   state capture inquiry the cost of state contracts  channelled to Gupta-linked entities was an estimated R57bn. The figure was an R8bn jump from Holden’s previous calculations when he testified at the same forum last month. He said the figure had changed because transactions that had been left out of  his previous report were now  included. These included: Of the R57bn, said Holden, R16.2bn was paid “directly or indirectly” to the Gupta enterprise, “all of which was drawn from SA state funds or kickbacks relating to state capture”. “One of the most disturbing features of following the Gupta enterprise has been discovering these incredibly elaborate onshore and offshore bridges. In total, looking at these bridges, we have identified 3,659 separate transactions moving from these onshore and offshore bridges into the Hong Kong/China laundering network.” TimesLIVE
