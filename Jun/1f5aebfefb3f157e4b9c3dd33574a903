Ten new Covid-19 cases among Nelson Mandela University (NMU) students in Gqeberha in the past 24 hours has prompted the university to suspend all face-to-face classes. According to a memo sent  to NMU staff and students on Tuesday, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the rate of infections across the province, a decision was taken   to hold virtual classes in an attempt to  bring the spread of the coronavirus  under control. “All mask-to-mask sessions will be halted from today [Tuesday] until we determine when it is safe to resume. “Likewise, all planned in-person assessments are to be transferred to online platforms or deferred until it is deemed safe to return to mask-to-mask sessions,” NMU said. “Lecturers will communicate changes to assessment, learning and teaching schedules in their modules.” According to the letter, many of the university’s students infected with Covid-19  had been asymptomatic and showed no signs of the virus. “This is why it becomes critical   to always wear a face mask in all our buildings and  when you are walking to or around campus,” NMU said. “This, accompanied by the other preventive measures of sanitising hands and maintaining a safe distance, will assist in the ongoing efforts to contain the virus and curb its impact on the academic project.” HeraldLIVE
