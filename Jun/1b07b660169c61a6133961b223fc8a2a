Although load-shedding in the past few weeks has  been on stages 1 and 2, Eskom announced on Wednesday that it will move to stage 4 from 2pm to 10pm. In an explanation provided by Eskom on the stages of load-shedding, the power utility said stage 4 will double the frequency of stage 2  cuts. Eskom said this means customers will be scheduled for load-shedding 12 times over a four-day period for two hours at a time, or 12 times over an eight-day period for four hours at a time. The power utility said stage 1 allows for up to 1,000MW of the national load to be shed. Stage 2 allows for  as much as 2,000MW  to be cut. Stage 3 allows for up to 3,000MW of the national load to be shed and stage 4 allows for  as much as 4,000MW  to be cut. Eskom said stage 1 requires the least amount of load-shedding, or three times over a four-day period for two hours at a time. When Eskom moves to stage 2  power cuts,Â this means there is a doubling of the frequency of stage 1, and customers are scheduled for load-shedding six times over  four days for two hours at a time. Stage 3 increases the frequency of stage 2 by 50%, which means customers will be scheduled for load-shedding nine times over  four days for two hours at a time. Stage 4 is  explained above. TimesLIVE
