Central African Republic on Friday appointed former finance minister Henri Marie Dondra as prime minister, the presidency said in a statement. On Thursday, Prime Minister Firmin Ngrebada announced his resignation and that of his government following legislative elections. The central African country has failed to find stability since a 2013 rebellion ousted former President Francois Bozize. President Faustin-Archange Touadera was sworn in for a second five-year term in March despite the opposition's call for a re-run of the December election over alleged irregularities and low turnout. The December polls were disrupted by militia attacks on major cities.
