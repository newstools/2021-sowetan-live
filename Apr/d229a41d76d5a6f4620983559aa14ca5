After joining Swallows on a short-term deal as a free agent, Bantu Mzwakali has revealed he still desires to return to Europe at the end of the season, unless the Birds give him a good offer to remain with them beyond this season. Mzwakali was unattached  three weeks ago when he signed  a deal that makes him a Swallows player until the end of the season. The 27-year-old attacking midfielder didn't renew his contract with Swedish top-flight side IF Brage last month. “If Swallows offer me something better, I can talk to my Swedish agent and tell him I am staying home. However, I still wish to go back to Europe and spend a few seasons there because I enjoyed everything there," Mzwakali told Sowetan. The Ajax Cape Town development product also told how Covid-19 played a role in him prematurely returning to Mzansi. Mzwakali had joined Brage from Mother City-based second tier side Cape Umoya in January last year. “I came back during the off-season in December. When it was time to go back [to Sweden], I couldn’t  because of Covid-19  restrictions on travel. My plan was always to stay longer in Europe. I had an option to renew my deal with Brage and they wanted to exercise that option until Covid-19 messed up all the plans," Mzwakali stated. He has already featured in two DStv Premiership games for the Birds thus far. "I can still go back  [to Brage] if the Covid-19 situation stabilises at the end of the season. The club wanted to keep me, so I don't think it would be hard to rejoin them. I thought it was better to sign a short-term deal with Swallows, rather than to sit at home and do nothing until the end of the season."
