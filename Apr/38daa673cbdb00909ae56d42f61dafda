Fourteen of Mpumalanga’s game reserves owned by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) have been shut  since Tuesday as employees downed tools, demanding better working conditions and for those in acting positions to be appointed permanently. The employees, led by the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), picketed outside the MTPA head office in Mbombela. “This employer  does not have an ear, they don’t listen. We said before they advertise the posts let us roll out [the] recruitment process, let us finalise the placement plan. But the arrogance from the employer is that they were not willing to come and engage with us. Another thing is the issue of salary disparities,” said Nehawu regional secretary Welcome Mnisi. MTPA chief executive Johannes Nobunga  labelled the strike illegal. “The illegal strike has been sparked by a  misunderstanding of the organogram which was set last year. On the issue of  hiring the acting employees, we decided to be fair  and advertise the posts so that anyone can apply," Nobunga said. "We have also advertised five positions for senior management. On the issue of moving employees to Mthethomusha game reserve, we had a problem there where the fence was damaged and we saw that the dangerous animals might hurt people in the nearby community. We had to get rangers from other reserves and also the Kruger National Park came to  assist because that was urgent.” Nobunga added that the strike is affecting the agency. “As we speak,  game reserves are closed, our head office is not functioning and we don’t know until when. Our tourists are being turned away as gates are closed. So we have asked to talk to the union and the employees to resolve this. And if they fail we will be forced to approach courts to get an interdict, which might be bad for them.”
