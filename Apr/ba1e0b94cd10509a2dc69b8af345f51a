Two men have been arrested for the murder of an off-duty KwaZulu-Natal police officer who attempted to save a  woman who was being assaulted in Verulam, north of Durban, at the weekend. In a statement on Tuesday the Hawks said members from the Durban organised crime unit made the arrests in Bergville in the KZN midlands. Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Simphiwe Mhlongo said the men, aged 18 and 25, were arrested for stabbing Sgt Nduduzo Sibiya, 36, to death on Sunday.
