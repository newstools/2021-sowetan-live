A Chinese court has ordered a man to compensate his ex-wife for five years' “unpaid labour” during their marriage. The case involved the man’s ex-wife seeking reparations for years of unpaid housework and parenting of their son. The BBC reports that the landmark court case comes after the introduction of a new civil policy in China that offers spousal compensation for partners who  shoulder most of the responsibility of being caregivers and running households. The court ruled the ex-wife will receive 50,000 yuan (more than R111,000) in the settlement. TimesLIVE
