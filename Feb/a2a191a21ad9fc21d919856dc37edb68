Former State Security Agency (SSA) director-general (DG) Arthur Fraser has laid a criminal charge of perjury after a week of allegations of corruption and malfeasance against the SSA at the state capture  inquiry. “The falsehoods peddled during what our client considers the monumental compromise of the country’s intelligence by SSA officials have left him with no choice but to lay criminal charges against those  who conspired to tell the nation blatant and deliberate falsehoods,” said Kgoroeadira Mudau Attorneys. Fraser laid charges at the Hillbrow police station in  Johannesburg on Sunday against: “Lies were told to the nation under oath and before the inquiry and the entire world, with the assistance of those employed to help the nation discover the truth. We consider such to be beyond any reason and it compromises the security of our people and their state,” the legal team charged on behalf of Fraser. Mufamadi, who led a panel review investigation of the agency in 2018, made allegations against Fraser at the inquiry last week, as did Jafta and Ms K. These include that Fraser enabled corruption and unaccountability involving at least R125m and allowed the agency to become a piggy bank for ANC factional battles. TimesLIVE
