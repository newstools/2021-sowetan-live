Bloemfontein Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco has been suspended by the club‚ but details of the reasons are unavailable.

Neither Tshabalala nor Konco‚ though‚ could confirm the details of the suspension‚ nor whether the CEO will face a disciplinary hearing. Asked if he could provide details of the reason for Konco’s the suspension‚ Tshabalala‚ reached on Thursday‚ would only say: “No‚ I can’t comment on that. No comment at all.” Asked if Konco will face a disciplinary hearing‚ Tshabalala again said: “Listen‚ I said no comment bra.” Konco confirmed his suspension‚ but also said he could not provide details on it. “It is true‚ but I can’t talk now‚” he said.
