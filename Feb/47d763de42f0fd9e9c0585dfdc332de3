Rescue efforts are under way at an ArcelorMittal plant in Vanderbiljpark, Vaal, following an explosion early on Wednesday. Three workers have been reported missing and probably trapped in post-blast rubble. According to the National Union of Mineworkers SA (Numsa), the explosion happened at around 2am on Wednesday.
