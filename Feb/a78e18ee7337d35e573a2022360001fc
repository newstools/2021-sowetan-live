Two new Covid-19 vaccination sites will be added in Gauteng, at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Tshwane and Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Gauteng premier David Makhura and health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi confirmed this while on a walkabout at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto on Friday. The inoculation programme  began almost two weeks ago in SA, with  16,800 doses of the vaccine allocated to  Gauteng. According to the office of the health MEC, Gauteng experienced a  vaccine backlog as the first phase of the programme  saw thousands of health-care workers coming to receive jabs, including workers from neighbouring provinces. Dr Merika Tsitsi, head of the Covid-19 vaccination programme at Bara, said close to 1,000 health-care workers have been receiving jabs every day this week. He also said all 16,800 doses allocated to the province  were expected to be administered by the end of  Friday. TimesLIVE
