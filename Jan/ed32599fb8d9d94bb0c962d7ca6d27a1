The Amathole District Municipality has made a U-turn on its decision to freeze salary payments to its employees. Last week, news emerged that the municipality  would not be able to pay salaries to 1,670 councillors, traditional leaders and  staff for four months, beginning in February,  because of strained financial resources. But on Monday, municipal manager Thandekile Mnyimba issued a circular to staff, informing them about the reversal of the decision to halt their salary payments. According to the circular, which TimesLIVE has confirmed as legitimate, the mayor  led a municipal delegation that met  provincial and national government representatives. Resolutions were agreed to on how to  strengthen and implement a sustainable financial recovery plan, with  workstreams  aimed at turning  the  municipality around. “Based on the progress and promising work mentioned above, I hereby withdraw the circular date 7 January 2021 as we put a collective effort in improving cash flow position with regular updates,” reads the circular.
