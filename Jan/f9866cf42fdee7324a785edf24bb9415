There are growing calls for Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa to cut short his annual holiday because the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has “run over” his government. One of his deputies, Constantino Chiwenga, effectively put the country on a 30-day lockdown that started on Tuesday. His other deputy, Kembo Mohadi, announced that this time around, individual effort was key in fighting the virus. “We are our own saviours and it is our behavioural change that will take us out of danger. There must be a major paradigm shift on behaviour. Let those that are infected now be the last as we all together strive that no-one else shall be infected,” Mohadi told journalists. Some reports in the local media claim that some cabinet ministers are battling Covid-19 infections. Through his official Twitter account, Mnangagwa said the current lockdown was the “final push”. But some, notably Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, an EFF MP  in SA, criticised Mnangagwa’s absence from the front line. Responding on Twitter, Ndlozi said: “Chief, can you stop grandstanding on Twitter. Take mobile test stations to your borders with SA. This is the most urgent problem NOW. The border is presenting a big super-spreader event. Oh, and are you actually tweeting from a holiday or from work?” Mnangagwa is  expected back at work only at the end of February. His predecessor, the late Robert Mugabe, also took leave around  the same time. Other ministers are also on leave, including minister of information Monica Mutsvangwa.
