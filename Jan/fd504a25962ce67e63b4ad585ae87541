A truck driver has been arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle counterfeit goods worth R6m into SA from Mozambique. Police spokesperson Brig Vish Naidoo said the 54-year-old foreigner was arrested at the Lebombo border post, in Komatipoort, Mpumalanga, on Monday. “The truck was returning to SA after offloading chrome in Maputo,” he said. A video circulating on social media showed police supervising as the tipper truck emptied its load onto the side of the road at the border post. TimesLIVE
