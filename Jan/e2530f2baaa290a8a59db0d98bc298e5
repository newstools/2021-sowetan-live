Police in Khayelitsha in the Western Cape seemingly scuttled the nefarious plans of two armed suspects roaming the streets of Mandela Park on New Year's Eve. According to a SAPS statement, “while law abiding citizens were confined to their homes” the pair cruised the streets in the early hours of the morning in a hired Nissan Almera. That is until they were spotted by members of the provincial integrated team, who were out in full force  conducting a crime operation. “The suspects were pulled over and a search of their vehicle led to the discovery of two unlicensed 9mm pistols and ammunition.” The suspects, aged 25 and 26, are expected to make a court appearance in Khayelitsha on Monday. They are charged with an offence in terms of the Disaster Management Act and  for possession of unlicensed firearms. TimesLIVE
