Education MEC Mmaphefo Matsemela said the  teacher had been suspended. “I hereby wish to condemn in its strongest terms any case of sexual assault against any learner within the province,” Matsemela said. “The department has placed the  teacher under  precautionary suspension pending the investigations. The department views these allegations in a very serious light and the precautionary suspension will allow the investigations to happen without any interference.” She pleaded with pupils not to keep quiet when someone is harassing them, saying they should report it to their parents, principals or any teacher they trust.
