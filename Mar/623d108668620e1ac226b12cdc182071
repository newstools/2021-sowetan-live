Johannesburg Water will restrict water supply  from a number of its reservoirs because of water shortages from its supplier Rand Water. It said Rand Water's distribution network was  under severe  pressure  as the demand for water  consistently exceeded the  supply. “The water entity requested Johannesburg Water to implement their water restrictions to prevent the situation where both supply systems collapse and Johannesburg Water has responded by restricting many of its reservoirs by between 20% and 45%," Johannesburg Water said in a statement. Johannesburg Water said some areas fed  by a number of reservoirs that had been restricted will experience low pressure to no water  while some will not be affected at all. Johannesburg Water's reservoirs that had been restricted include Sandton No 1 and Sandton No 2, North East Areas, Malvern East, Linksfield Ridge, Protea Glen, Diepkloof, Roodepoort Deep Township, Chiawelo, Diepsloot, Zondi Power Park, Fleurhof,  Florida North and Lenasia Township. Johannesburg Water said alternative water supply will be rolled out to areas  affected  and tanker supply will be rolled out as and when required. “We plead with  residents  to use water sparingly and  to report all service interruptions through the call centre and on social media.” TimesLIVE
