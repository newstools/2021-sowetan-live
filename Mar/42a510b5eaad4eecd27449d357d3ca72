The contracts of the health-care workers hired to bolster the Eastern Capeâ€™s front line to fight Covid-19 have been extended by three months, while those working in communities were pushed to 12 months. The contracts were signed in February 2020, with the health-care workers hired for one year, from April 1 2020 to March 31 2021. This came at a cost of R900m.

The Nelson Mandela Bay health district contracted 1,095 workers in various positions. For more on this article, please visit HeraldLIVE.
