It is  disturbing that a black person will say that  traditional attire  is not allowed in a public space. it’s  even more shocking that he says it is indecent. I’m  pointing to the black person because he is supposed to know better as he  even said he is Tswana-speaking. We  would have been more vocal if he was a white person and attached race to the issue. To further say that a person in such attire must  not even be allowed to purchase anything is immoral  to the core. I don’t  remember any mall or shopping centre that has such notices  or policies against  traditional attire. To suspend that person is a good move by the shopping management. But that individual must also apologise to the public, especially the black community that made him what he is today. I wonder what his reaction  would have been if  nationals like the Nigerians or those from the Ivory Coast enter that mall with their regalia, as they pride themselves on their appearance. How then do we convince the white community to respect and accept  our cultures if we cannot be proud ourselves? I hope the co-operative governance  & traditional affairs minister takes note and really condemns such unethical moral behaviour. Andries Monyane, Sedibeng district.
