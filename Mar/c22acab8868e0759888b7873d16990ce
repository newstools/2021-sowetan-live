A study conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and published in eBioMedicine could possibly contribute to finding a cure for HIV. eBioMedicine forms part of The Lancet family of medical journals. The study analysed samples taken from patients  who have been living with the human immunodeficiency virus between  1987 and 2019. The lead scientist in the research, Mary Rodgers, said: “When we first started to see the data coming in from the study we were surprised, but we were also elated. This could mean  this is something  we can  cure.” According to the BBC, the medical research discovered  4% of HIV carriers in the DRC were able to suppress the virus. Commonly less than 1% of those living with the immunodeficiency virus can do that. TimesLIVE
