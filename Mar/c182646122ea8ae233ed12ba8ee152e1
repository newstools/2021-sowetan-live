He won’t play tomorrow [on Saturday]. And hopefully things will get sorted out. “It’s obviously a difficult time for him‚ so‚ ja‚ he won’t be playing tomorrow.” Chiefs’ communications manager Vina Maphosa said the club would offer all the support it could to Khune and his family. “From Kaizer Chiefs Football Club we send our condolences to Itumeleng Khune and his family‚” Maphosa said. “And we as the club have got mechanisms to work with players when they are faced with challenges‚ and we have instituted all that to support the player‚ and we are with the family during this trying time.” Khune’s sister‚ Mapula Meiki Khune (27)‚ died in a fire when the room she was sleeping in at the family home in Ventersdorp burnt down‚ reportedly in the early hours of Thursday morning.
