Police tactical forces led by Western Cape organised crime narcotics unit detectives seized a massive haul of R583m worth of cocaine from a fishing vessel off the coast of Saldanha on Monday evening. Four Bulgarian nationals and six suspects from Myanmar were arrested and charged with dealing in drugs during the late night raid. An “extensive” intelligence-driven operation saw tactical forces descending on the vessel where 973 blocks of compressed cocaine were found in three compartments of the vessel. Western Cape police spokesperson Brig Novela Potelwa said the suspects were due to appear in the Vredenburg magistrate's court soon. “Further investigations continue as the detectives determine the origins as well as the intended destination of the consignment,” said Potelwa. “SAPS management has hailed the find as a step in the right direction in efforts to deal with the illicit drug trade.” TimesLIVE
