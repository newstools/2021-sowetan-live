Ghana's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld President Nana Akufo-Addo's election victory, rejecting a challenge by the runner-up John Mahama who had alleged irregularities in the results. Akufo-Addo was declared the winner of the December 7 vote with 51.59%, ahead of former president Mahama, who received 47.37%. Mahama alleged that votes had been added to Akufo-Addo's total in some polling stations, pushing him above the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. The court said his allegations were without merit. â€œThe petitioner did not demonstrate in any way how the alleged errors ... affected the validity of the (results)," said Chief Justice Kwasi Anin-Yeboah. At least five people were killed in election-related violence, a rarity in a country that has a reputation as one of West Africa's most stable democracies.
