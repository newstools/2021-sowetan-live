Supporters of former president Jacob Zuma descended on the Pietermaritzburg high court precinct on Wednesday morning, dressed in T-shirts with the slogan “Hands Off Zuma”, ahead of his appearance on corruption and fraud charges. Some of them had stayed overnight in the precinct. The precinct was a hive of activity, with hawkers selling ANC memorabilia, having set up stalls around Freedom Square, where a stage has been erected for Zuma to address supporters after court proceedings.
