And you get 10% off your first online purchase!* Lacoste is seeing life through rose — or red, green and yellow-tinted glasses again in 2021: unfiltered, close-up and wide-angle. The best way to good vibes is a brand-new collaboration between the crocodile brand and the iconic Polaroid brand for a technicolour capsule collection that’s bold, colourful and fun. Watch the video: For Spring 2021, Lacoste dug deep into this legendary, high-colour and cultural heritage. Inspired by Polaroid’s famous rainbow logo from its first instant colour film developed in 1963, the Lacoste x Polaroid collection centres on the distinctive blue, green, yellow, orange and red rainbow from the creative brand. The Lacoste crocodile marches across bold, block-colour backgrounds on classic polos and hoodies, while polo dresses and shirts in oversized stripes make for a supercharged silhouette that stands out. United by the characteristic Polaroid rainbow spectrum and the Lacoste pieces in the collection, each shot is a tribute to joy, boldness and freedom. The collaboration is available online and in-store.
