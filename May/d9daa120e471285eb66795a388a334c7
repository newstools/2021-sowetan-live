While I may not claim any expertise in the field of football, but as a former administrator of Schools Soccer Association in the 1980s and a teacher, I would like to send a word of caution to Benni McCarthy. Coaching in the professional rank is like being a political party leader, there are no permanent friends or  foes. You are as good as it lasts. I would like to advise McCarthy to stick to coaching Amazulu as of now and enjoy the friendship and support he has with the management of that team. It will go a long way in gaining him more experience. But if McCarthy starts looking into what he thinks is a glorified post of being a national coach, he will become distracted  from what he is  good at now and start losing games. Coaching a SA national team may be any coach's ambition but like political party leadership, it is a short-lived position. He must take a cue from those who went before him. He is still young in this field of coaching. Let him remain coaching a professional team as he does now and wait. His time will come, lest he will regret. Makgato Raletsatsi, GaKgapane
