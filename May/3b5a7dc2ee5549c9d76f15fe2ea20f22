It said that “tender advertisements with the  contract numbers WS7373, WS7374, WS7375, WS7376 and WS7377 were  all fake, and that it wished to distance itself from the hoax e-mail. “Municipal contracts are not for sale and city representatives are not permitted to solicit any payment from potential tenderers.” Residents with information regarding the matter are urged to report it to the authorities.
