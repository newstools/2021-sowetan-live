There is a large media presence outside the Durban central police station, where former Ukhozi FM DJ and commentator Ngizwe Mchunu is expected to hand himself over to  officers. Mchunu made a public announcement on social media on Saturday that he would be handing himself over to police following allegations that he is one of those implicated in the protests, destruction and looting in KwaZulu-Natal. Although the police confirmed  they  expect Mchunu to hand himself over, they could not comment on what charges he  will face. Mchunu left the radio station in 2020 following an internal disciplinary about confidential information. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
