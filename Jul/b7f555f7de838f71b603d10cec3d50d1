The South African under-23 Olympic team suffered a huge blow following the withdrawal of five players due to various medical reasons. The players released from the camp are: Lyle Foster‚ Fagrie Lakay‚ Abbubaker Mobara‚ Sipho Mbule and Keletso Makgalwa (a standby player). The changes in the camp come a week after the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) announced the final under-23 men’s Olympic squad for the rescheduled Tokyo Olympic Games to take place between July 22 and August 8. The South Africans are in Group A together with hosts Japan‚ the team they play on July 22 at the Tokyo Stadium‚ and France‚ the side they meet at Saitama Stadium on July 25. The under-23s will then round off their group stage matches against Mexico at the Sapporo Dome on July 28. Coach David Notoane will announce replacements soon.
