Pat was very loud and loved fashion. He enjoyed arguing I even said to him that he was supposed to be a lawyer. Pat would argue with you even if you are right until you end up feeling that you are the one who is wrong. He was full of jokes and loved music. “I noticed that lately, Pat was very frustrated by the fact that he could not work due to lockdown. He recently released a mbaqanga album but it did not do well because of what is happening in the country. Not being able to work was really frustrating him.”
