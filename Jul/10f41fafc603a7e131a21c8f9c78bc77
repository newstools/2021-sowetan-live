Struggle songs  echoed across Nkandla's valleys as amabutho warriors descended on former president Jacob Zuma's home on Saturday. After the Constitutional Court  sentenced the former president to  15 months' imprisonment for contempt of court, the warriors have joined MKMVA veterans in vowing to protect Zuma. Zuma, who had allegedly arrived late the  evening before, briefly joined the amabutho outside his home. While addressing members of the media, Zuma's eldest son Edward  criticised members of the ANC  after the postponement of this weekend's NEC meeting,  to send senior party members to Nkandla. “They've had all the years to communicate and discuss with President Zuma. What do you think they'll be discussing with President Zuma? Why were they quiet all these years? Why should we therefore listen to them now?” he said. Zuma has received visits from various politicians, including Ace Magashule and  KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala. The Constitutional Court has granted Zuma a chance to  make an application  to rescind  its judgment on July 12. The former president is expected to deliver an address later on Sunday. TimesLIVE
